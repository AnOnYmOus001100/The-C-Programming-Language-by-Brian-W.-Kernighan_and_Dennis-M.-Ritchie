### Description Of C Programming Language from the Book The C Programming Language by K&R(2nd ed)
C is a general-purpose programming language which features economy of
expression, modern control flow and data structures, and a rich set of operators.
C is not a "very high level" language, nor a "big" one, and is not specialized to
any particular area of application. But its absence of restrictions and its gen-
erality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks than supposedly
more powerful languages

C was originally designed for and implemented on the UNIX operating sys-
tem on the DEC PDP-ll, by Dennis Ritchie.
